# Working-with-Dates

Found this question being asked many times by the companies to people applying for Python or Data Science Internships.

Write a function in python that inputs a dataframe and identify which columns have date in them. Using these date columns make new columns which are difference between these columns taking 2 at a time. (for instance if there is date1, date2, date3 columns, output should be like date1-date2, date2-date3, date1-date3)

Thing to consider
· Date column might have some invalid entries in them
· Date can be of different format throughout the column
· Code should be robust enough to run on any dataset
